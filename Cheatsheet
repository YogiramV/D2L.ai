---------------------------Introduction-----------------------------------
- In Machine learning, the learning is the process by which we discover the right setting of the knobs for coercing the desired behavior from our model.
- Key components: Data, Model, Objective function(or Loss function), Optmization Algorithms.
- Data: Garbage in, Garbage out.
- ML kinds
    - Supervised Learning
        - Regression (How many?)
        - Classification (Which one?)
        - Tagging
        - Search
        - Sequence Learning
    - Unsupervised and Self-Supervised Learning
        - Clustering
        - Principal Component Analysis
    - Offline learning
